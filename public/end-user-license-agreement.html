        <h3>1.1 Definitions</h3>
        <div><p>For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:</p>
<p>"API" or "Application Programming Interface" means the technical software interface and protocols that allow the App to communicate with and access services provided by third-party platforms, including Coinbase. Through APIs, the App can send and receive data and instructions to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions without directly accessing or controlling the underlying systems.</p>
<p>"Coinbase" means the Coinbase entity or entities that provide the wallet services, payment infrastructure, and blockchain transaction capabilities accessible through the App's integration, including but not limited to Coinbase, Inc., Coinbase Global, Inc., and/or Coinbase Bermuda Technologies Limited. Users acknowledge that their use of Coinbase services through the App is also governed by Coinbase's applicable Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p></div>
        <h3>1.2 Agreement to Terms</h3>
        <div><p>By accessing, downloading, or using the App or Services, you agree to be bound by this End User License Agreement ("Agreement" or "Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. Your continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of any updates or modifications to these Terms.</p></div></div><div class="section">
      <h2>2. Software License and Restrictions</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Scope of License</h3>
        <div><p>The App is licensed, not sold, to you. The Company grants you a limited, nontransferable license to use the App on any Android-powered device that you own or control and as permitted by the Google Play Terms of Service.</p>
<p>This license does not allow you to use the App on any Android device that you do not own or control, and you may not distribute or make the App available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time.</p></div>
        <h3>2.2 License Restrictions</h3>
        <div><p>You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to:</p>

</ul>
<p>The foregoing restrictions apply except to the extent that any such restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the App. Any attempt to violate these restrictions is a violation of the rights of the Company and its licensors. If you breach these restrictions, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.</p>
<p>The terms of this license will govern any upgrades provided by the Company that replace and/or supplement the original App, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.</p></div>
        <h3>2.3 Consent to Use of Technical Data</h3>
        <div><p>You agree that the Company may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the App. The Company may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.</p></div>
        <h3>2.4 License Termination</h3>
        <div><p>The license granted under this Agreement is effective until terminated by you or the Company. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Company if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this license. Upon termination of the license, you shall cease all use of the App and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the App.</p></div></div><div class="section">
      <h2>3. Registration and Account Requirements</h2>

<li>Register and create an account</li>
<li>Provide complete and accurate identifying information</li>
<li>Comply with all Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) verification requirements</li>
<li>Confirm that you are using the account for yourself and not on behalf of any other person</li>
</ul></div>
        <h3>3.2 Identity Verification and User Representations</h3>
        <div><p>The Company makes reasonable efforts to verify User identity through KYC and AML procedures before account creation. However, the Company cannot guarantee the accuracy of information provided by Users and shall not be liable for any losses, damages, or claims arising from:</p>
<ul>
<li>A User's misrepresentation of their identity</li>
<li>False or fraudulent information provided during registration</li>
<li>Unauthorized use of another person's identity or credentials</li>
<li>Any failure of third-party identity verification services</li>

        <h3>3.3 Account Security</h3>
        <div><p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account credentials, passcodes, and any devices used to access the App. You agree to immediately notify the Company and Coinbase (at https://help.coinbase.com) of any unauthorized use of your account or any other security breach. The Company shall not be liable for any losses arising from unauthorized access to your account.</p></div>
        <h3>3.4 Account Termination</h3>
        <div><p>The Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse or stop offering access to the Services at any time, at our sole discretion, with or without notice, for any reason including but not limited to violation of these Terms or applicable laws.</p></div>
        <h3>3.5 Digital Signature and Photographic Capture</h3>
        <div><p>When Users enter into a transaction agreement through the App, they are required to sign the agreement using the App's digital signature functionality. By using this feature, you acknowledge and consent to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photographic Capture During Signing:</strong> The App's front-facing camera will capture your photograph at the time of signing. You will be notified immediately before the photograph is taken, and you may cancel the entire signing process at that point if you do not wish to have your photograph captured.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Photographic Capture:</strong> The front-facing camera image serves as a security measure to help verify the identity of the signing party in the event of a transaction dispute. This image may provide information on whether the identity of the person who signed the agreement matches the identity of the person making a dispute claim.</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary Participation:</strong> By proceeding with the signing process after receiving notification of the photographic capture, you voluntarily consent to having your photograph taken and stored in accordance with this Agreement and our Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="section">
      <h2>4. Service Description and Third-Party Integrations</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Service Facilitation</h3>
        <div><p>The Company facilitates interactions between Users and Coinbase (as defined herein) through the use of Coinbase's APIs (as defined herein), which allow the App to access Coinbase's wallet and payment infrastructure services. The Company does not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage or execute transfers of funds</li>
<li>Provide services to purchase cryptocurrency</li>
<li>Manage or hold private keys for cryptocurrency wallets</li>
<li>Have custody of cryptocurrency during any holding period</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company provides an interface for Users to transfer funds via Coinbase's financial infrastructure and through independent smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. All wallet functionality and cryptocurrency management are provided by Coinbase, and the smart contracts described in Section 4.3 operate autonomously and outside Coinbase's custody. The Company solely provides an interface for interaction between Users, Coinbase APIs, and these smart contracts. Except as described in Section 7 (Holding Period and Dispute Resolution), where the Company may submit predefined on-chain instructions to signal a refund decision pursuant to the smart contract's immutable logic, the Company has no discretionary control over cryptocurrency transfers or funds.</p></div>
        <h3>4.2 External Services and Third-Party Materials</h3>
        <div><p>The App may enable access to the Company's and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). Use of the External Services requires Internet access and use of certain External Services requires you to accept additional terms.</p>
<p>You understand that by using any of the External Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the External Services at your sole risk and that neither the Company nor its agents shall have any liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.</p>
<p>Certain External Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or materials from third parties ("Third Party Materials") or provide links to certain third party websites. By using the External Services, you acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor its agents is responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or websites. Neither the Company nor its agents warrant or endorse and does not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party services, Third Party Materials or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other websites are provided solely as a convenience to you.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Information Disclaimer:</strong> Financial information displayed by any External Services is for general informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon information obtained through the External Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region.</p>
<p><strong>Location Data Disclaimer:</strong> Location data provided by any External Services is for basic navigational purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Neither the Company, nor its agents, nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data or any other data displayed by any External Services.</p>
<p>You agree that the External Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by the Company and/or its agents or licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright, and that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever except for permitted use of the External Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this EULA or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or the Company. No portion of the External Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means.</p>
<p>You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the External Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit the External Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the External Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the External Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that neither the Company nor its agents is in any way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive, infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the External Services.</p>
<p>In addition, External Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed from, displayed on or linked to from Android devices are not available in all languages or in all countries or regions. The Company makes no representation that such External Services and Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access such External Services and Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws. The Company reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any External Services at any time without notice. In no event will the Company be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such External Services. The Company may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain External Services, in any case and without notice or liability.</p></div>
        <h3>4.3 Smart Contract Infrastructure</h3>
        <div><p>For transactions involving a cryptocurrency holding period, User funds are held in self-executing smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Base network. These smart contracts are autonomous and non-custodial—they are not owned or operated by the Company.</p>
<p>The Company does not at any time hold, store, or have access to User private keys or cryptocurrency funds. The Company cannot confiscate, freeze, or otherwise obtain any User's funds. Any actions by the Company under Section 7 (Holding Period and Dispute Resolution) consist solely of submitting predefined, on-chain instructions to the smart contract pursuant to its immutable logic. The Company's submission of a refund decision constitutes an on-chain signal within the smart contract's parameters and does not involve direct custody or manual transfer of cryptocurrency assets.</p>
<p>Current contract addresses (subject to update upon redeployment):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum Contract: 0x84Dc03077CA4E99a6d853DAfD0C2b1D7576cbB88</li>
<li>USDC Contract: 0xc2Ed1C8505dd22DB3F484575F3DED745E347b887</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company provides the smart contract interface as a technical utility only and does not act as an intermediary, escrow agent, or fiduciary.</p></div></div><div class="section">
