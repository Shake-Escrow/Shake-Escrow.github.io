    "questions": [
      { "question": "How does the app work?", "answer": "Shake uses an escrow, which is like a safe, that keeps the customer’s money secure while a business delivers a product or service. To learn more, see the “How it Works” page." },
      { "question": "What is an escrow?", "answer": "An escrow is like a safe that keeps the money secure and ensures both the customer and business are fulfilling their obligations before the exchange is made. \n\nFor example, let’s say you’re buying a used phone from someone you found online. Normally, you’d meet up, pay them on the spot, and hope the phone works. But if it’s broken or not what they promised, it’s already too late — the money’s gone. \n\nWith escrow, instead of paying them directly, your money goes into a secure holding account for a fixed amount of time. The seller sees the money is there, and hands over the phone. \n\nDuring the waiting period, you check the quality of the phone. If you discover it's broken, you would dispute the transaction and request a refund. If the phone works, the money is released to the seller once the waiting period is over. \n\nIn essence, the escrow:    \n1) Protects businesses by ensuring that the customer’s payment is ready and available for transfer once the waiting period is over    \n2) Provides a safety net for the customer by ensuring that their money is held securely and potentially returned if they are not satisfied. \n\nTo learn more, see the “How it Works” page." },
      { "question": "Do I need to know about crypto / invest in crypto to use Shake?", "answer": "No, you do not need to know about or invest in crypto to use Shake. That’s the magic of it." },
      { "question": "Who can use the Shake app?", "answer": "Shake is available for those over the age of 18. Creating a Shake account requires identity verification from the Persona service (withpersona.com)." },
      { "question": "Do I have to accept any ‘arbitrary’ cryptocurrency as payment?", "answer": "No, you specify which crypto you want to receive. When it comes time to withdraw your funds, we integrate with Coinbase to withdraw them to any account Coinbase can access. " },
      { "question": "How long does it take to send or accept a payment? Is there an instant transfer fee?", "answer": "Blockchain transfer times are much faster than credit card transactions. There is no instant transfer fee." },
      { "question": "Are there fees to use Shake?", "answer": "Shake is free to use, but blockchain gas fees apply to transactions. These fees are generally lower than traditional credit card fees, with the customer paying the gas fees for the purchasing side and the business paying on the withdrawal side. \n\nIn general, Shake is designed to minimize costs and maximize what you keep, especially compared to credit card transactions. The blockchain is more direct, transparent, and often cheaper than the bank-based systems it's replacing."},
      { "question": "Are there any income requirements to use Shake?", "answer": "No, there are no income requirements to use Shake." },
      { "question": "Can I accept international transactions with Shake?", "answer": "Yes, you can accept international transactions from any other Shake user, regardless of country." },
      { "question": "Are there any spending requirements, limits or transaction caps?", "answer": "There are no spending limits or transaction caps imposed by Shake itself." },
      { "question": "What happens if there is a dispute?", "answer": "Shake’s process records metadata and provides transaction information to resolve disputes. Shake is the default arbiter for disputes. Arbiters issue refunds when warranted. Our next feature is to allow the buyer and seller to delegate any Shake user as the arbiter for their transaction." },
      { "question": "How does Shake protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions?", "answer": "Shake implements a two-factor authentication (2FA) for transactions exceeding an amount you determine (maximum $10,000) as an extra layer of security designed to protect users from financial fraud and unauthorized high-value transactions." },
      { "question": "Why can’t Shake or a hacker take my money and run?", "answer": "Beneath the contract you sign, Shake uses a Smart Contract developed by Circle Internet Group, Inc. Circle manages the stablecoin, USDC, which we have also integrated into transactions. Circle’s Smart Contract makes it impossible for Shake or any other entity to take the payer’s money. It would take billions of years to hack the blockchain. Money in escrow (the safe) may only go to the business, or in the case of a refund, back to the customer. \n\nIf there is a dispute, Shake helps resolve it fairly — but doesn’t ever hold or take your money (except to refund it). Your cryptocurrency is held by algorithms that have been in use for over 9 years, and have a proven track record." },
      { "question": "What is documented when I make a transaction?", "answer": "Shake encrypts all data and logs every detail: Time, location, signatures, and photos that you provide. Each party’s device also takes a front-facing photo of the signer as they are signing. Delivery confirmation can be uploaded, and the system confirms the money is available before a transaction happens." },
      { "question": "How does Shake create accountability?", "answer": "Every Shake user has a verified identity and feedback score. Persona checks each member’s ID, so no one can make unlimited wallets to hide from accountability." },
      { "question": "What information is public?", "answer": "While transactions are recorded on the blockchain (which is publicly viewable but anonymous), personal Shake accounts and blockchain accounts are not publicly associated. " },
      { "question": "Is there support for splitting shared expenses amongst a group?", "answer": "While this isn't currently supported, it is on our roadmap for future implementation." }
