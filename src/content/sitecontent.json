This design removes single-point-of-failure risk and ensures funds can only move according to the agreed rules."

    "questions": [
      { "question": "How does the app work?", "answer": "Shake uses an escrow, which is like a safe, that keeps the customer’s money secure while a business delivers a product or service. To learn more, see the “How it Works” page." },
      { "question": "What is an escrow?", "answer": "An escrow is like a safe that keeps the money secure and ensures both the customer and business are fulfilling their obligations before the exchange is made. \n\nFor example, let’s say you’re buying a used phone from someone you found online. Normally, you’d meet up, pay them on the spot, and hope the phone works. But if it’s broken or not what they promised, it’s already too late — the money’s gone. \n\nWith escrow, instead of paying them directly, your money goes into a secure holding account for a fixed amount of time. The seller sees the money is there, and hands over the phone. \n\nDuring the waiting period, you check the quality of the phone. If you discover it's broken, you would dispute the transaction and request a refund. If the phone works, the money is released to the seller once the waiting period is over. \n\nIn essence, the escrow:    \n1) Protects businesses by ensuring that the customer’s payment is ready and available for transfer once the waiting period is over    \n2) Provides protection for both parties by ensuring funds are held securely and can only be released according to the agreed escrow terms, including refunds when warranted by a dispute outcome. \n\nTo learn more, see the “How it Works” page." },
      { "question": "Do I need to know about crypto / invest in crypto to use Shake?", "answer": "No, you do not need to know about or invest in crypto to use Shake. That’s the magic of it." },
      { "question": "Who can use the Shake app?", "answer": "Shake is available for those over the age of 18. Creating a Shake account requires identity verification from the Persona service (withpersona.com)." },
      { "question": "Do I have to accept any ‘arbitrary’ cryptocurrency as payment?", "answer": "No, you specify which crypto you want to receive. When it comes time to withdraw your funds, we integrate with Coinbase to withdraw them to any account Coinbase can access. " },
      { "question": "How long does it take to send or accept a payment? Is there an instant transfer fee?", "answer": "Blockchain transfer times are much faster than credit card transactions. There is no instant transfer fee." },
      { "question": "Are there fees to use Shake?", "answer": "Shake charges a simple, transparent service fee for escrowed transactions. The standard fee is 0.1% of the transaction amount. \n\nIf a merchant chooses to withdraw funds early (before the escrow period ends), an additional early withdrawal fee applies, up to 1% for a 2-day early withdrawal. \n\nBlockchain network fees may also apply, and are paid directly to the network. Currency conversion (fiat ↔ crypto) is handled by Coinbase Onramp and Offramp, which may apply their own fees depending on the asset used. \n\nShake does not add hidden fees, does not take custody of funds, and does not charge recurring subscription fees for basic use."},
      { "question": "Are there any income requirements to use Shake?", "answer": "No, there are no income requirements to use Shake." },
      { "question": "Can I accept international transactions with Shake?", "answer": "Yes, you can accept international transactions from any other Shake user, regardless of country." },
      { "question": "Are there any spending requirements, limits or transaction caps?", "answer": "There are no spending limits or transaction caps imposed by Shake itself." },
      { "question": "What happens if there is a dispute?", "answer": "Shake’s process records metadata and provides transaction information to resolve disputes. Shake is the default arbiter for disputes. Arbiters issue refunds when warranted. Our next feature is to allow the buyer and seller to delegate any Shake user as the arbiter for their transaction." },
      { "question": "How does Shake protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions?", "answer": "Shake protects against fraud and unauthorized transactions with verified identities, signed agreements for each transaction, and verifiable on-chain proof of payment, backed by detailed records for dispute resolution." },
      { "question": "Why can’t Shake or a hacker take my money and run?", "answer": "Shake does not have custody of user funds. Payments are held by a smart contract that can only release funds to the merchant after the escrow period, or back to the buyer in the case of a refund. \n\nShake cannot access, move, or redirect escrowed funds. Coinbase provides wallet infrastructure and currency exchange, but escrow logic is enforced by blockchain code — not by human discretion." },
      { "question": "What is documented when I make a transaction?", "answer": "Shake encrypts all data and logs every detail: Time, location, signatures, and photos that you provide. Each party’s device also takes a front-facing photo of the signer as they are signing. Delivery confirmation can be uploaded, and the system confirms the money is available before a transaction happens." },
      { "question": "How does Shake create accountability?", "answer": "Every Shake user has a verified identity and feedback score. Persona checks each member’s ID, so no one can make unlimited wallets to hide from accountability." },
      { "question": "What information is public?", "answer": "While transactions are recorded on the blockchain (which is publicly viewable but anonymous), personal Shake accounts and blockchain accounts are not publicly associated. " },
      { "question": "Is there support for splitting shared expenses amongst a group?", "answer": "While this isn't currently supported, it is on our roadmap for future implementation." }
